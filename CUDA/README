Use the given Makefile to compile the code. This implementation uses Cilk for the parallel implementation of the code.

Type 'make' on the console to compile the program. Then run 'main.o' with the following three command line argument:

1) Image Size - For 16x16 image, give 16
2) Create Image - Give 0 if you dont want to create a new image. 1 if you want to create a new image. The code uses 'image.raw' fil to read the image. When a new image is created, that file is overwritten. So make sure that your file has the correct size of image
3) Use parallel - Give 0 if you want to run the Serial code. Give 1 if you want to run the parallel implementation of the code.




We have also provided some file to test our code. 'SmallTest.cu' compares the result of parallel impementation with a known result of some small image. Use 'make smalltest' to compile it . Use 'smalltest.o' to run it.


'Test.cu' first runs the serial code and then the parallel code and then compares their output. It takes image size as a command line argument. To compile it, use 'make test' and then run it using 'test.o'. 


Make sure to run this on a node with GPU, otherwise it will give an error
